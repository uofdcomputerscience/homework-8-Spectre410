U of D Mobile Development Homework 8

This is either the easiest or most difficult homework yet.

For this homework assignment, I need you to describe your intended final project to me. Include any intended data sources, sketches, and ask questions if needed.

A puzzle game app

The game will consist of a grid of buttons each with a particular shape attached to them, ( a +, -,|, or an L )
Tapping a button will rotate the shape 90 degrees to the right. 
At the bottom center and the top center of the grid are the start/end nodes, with the goal being to connect a path from the bottom to the top. 
Once a path has been determined, the player can press a button at the bottom of the screen to test if their path is correct. As it travels through the grid, it will change the color of the lines between the Grid to blue.
If the path reaches the end, a score screen will display with the user's time. With a button that continues to the next level.
There will be three levels of varying difficulty possibly with additional paths.. 

The app will have a login screen with a working name/pass system, as well as an error display system. 
The User will have a currentLevel, as well as bestScore for each level.
